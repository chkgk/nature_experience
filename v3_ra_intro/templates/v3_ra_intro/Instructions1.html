    <p>
        You will be a player in a game. Here are the rules. 
    </p>
    <p>
        There is the player, a co-player, and a virtual urn that contains 100 balls, some red, some green. 
    </p>

    <p>
        For each player, three factors together determine the payoff:
        <ol>
            <li>The draw of a ball from the urn,</li>
            <li>the player's own action, and</li>
            <li>their co-player’s action.</li>
        </ol>
    </p>
    <p>
        The player and the co-player take one of two actions, either option <b>A</b> or option <b>B</b>. The urn from which the ball is drawn contains 20 <b>red</b> balls and 80 <b>green</b> balls. Both player and co-player learn the color of the draw and the other player’s action at the end of the round.
    </p>
    <p>
        If a <b>red</b> ball is drawn, the actions of the player and the co-player do not matter for the outcome.  The player receives nothing (US$ 0). So does the co-player (US$ 0).
    </p>
    <p>
        If a green ball is drawn, then the actions of the player and the co-player matter for the outcome. There are four possibilities:
        <ul>
            <li>A <b>green</b> ball is drawn and the player’s <b>action is A</b> and the <b>co-player’s action is A</b>: The player receives US$ 1. So does the co-player (US$ 1).</li>
            <li>A <b>green</b> ball is drawn and the player’s <b>action is A</b> and the <b>co-player’s action is B</b>: The player receives US$ 1. The co-player receives US$ 3.</li>
            <li>A <b>green</b> ball is drawn and the player’s <b>action is B</b> and the <b>co-player’s action is A</b>: The player receives US$ 3. The co-player receives US$ 1.</li>
            <li>A <b>green</b> ball is drawn and the player’s <b>action is B</b> and the <b>co-player’s action is B</b>: The player receives nothing (US$ 0). So does the co-player (US$ 0).</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
        In a previous experiment, the co-players’ action was <b>A</b> in about 60 out of 100 cases and <b>B</b> in about 40 out of 100 cases.
    </p>
